# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe project for assesments.

## Requirements
Project: The general idea of a “naughts and crosses” type game that can be played between against a computer opponent, or another human opponent. The study level (5, 6 or 7) will determine which flavour of the project a student should build, although the student is free to choose which flavour they will build.

Technologies:
C#
Xamarin
Visual Studio/Code
Html, Javascript, CSS etc etc (Web technologies)
Windows Forms

Requirements:
As a general guideline, it is recommended that students should build the project which aligns with their study level.

Code should be controlled via source control
Questions and independant research should be abundant


Level 5:
A basic WPF or Web application that uses the above technologies to engage the user(s) in a “naughts and crosses” game. This application is not networked, and should be played on the computer. 

It is expected that 
Students will follow Microsoft’s C# Best Practices for their coding style
Make use of OOP


Level 6:
A basic Xamarin mobile (Android/WP/iOS) application that uses the above technologies to engage the user(s) in a “naughts and crosses” game. This application is not networked, and should be played on the mobile device. Students are free to build this project as cross-platform, or focus on one platform primarily.

It is expected that 
Students will follow Microsoft’s C# Best Practices for their coding style
Make use of OOP
Unit tests will be created


Level 7:
A basic WPF, Xamarin or Web application  that uses the above technologies to engage the user(s) in a “naughts and crosses” game. This application is networked, and should be played on either the computer or mobile device. 

It is expected that
